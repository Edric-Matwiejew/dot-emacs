#+title: My Emacs configuration files

See [[file:init.org][init.org]] for the configuration file with full commentary. You can also find in my blog at https://zzamboni.org/post/my-emacs-configuration-with-commentary/.

See [[file:init.el][init.el]] for the resulting configuration file which is loaded by Emacs. This file is generated automatically from =init.org= using Org-mode.

See [[file:custom.el][custom.el]] for all the settings maintained through Emacs' customization mechanism. Some of these values are set in my init file, others are set by hand.

If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to open an issue at https://gitlab.com/zzamboni/dot-emacs/-/issues.
